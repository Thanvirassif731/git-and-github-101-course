# Git Fundamentals

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that tracks changes to your files, allowing you to go back to earlier versions if needed. It's like a "save point" system for your projects.

### Why it matters

In software development, projects evolve constantly. Without version control, managing updates, fixes, or collaborating with others becomes messy and error-prone.

### 🛠️ How it works

* You create a repository (`repo`) for your project.
* Every time you make changes, you **commit** those changes.
* You can **revert** to previous states, create **branches** to test features, and **merge** changes when ready.

### 🧪 Try it Yourself

Think of a simple project like writing a blog post. Manually save versions every few changes:

```
blog-draft.txt  
blog-edited.txt  
blog-final.txt
```

Now imagine a tool that does all of this for you and lets you jump between versions. That’s what Git does.
